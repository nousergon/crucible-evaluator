metric_record.py — the evaluator-side factory for ``MetricRecord`` (RC v2).

The Pydantic contract + the pure status/letter/trend derivation live in
``krepis.metrics`` (the shared chokepoint so producer and consumers
agree). This module is the evaluator's *construction* convenience: one
``build_metric`` call that fills the full record from the raw measured value —
running the lib's ``derive_status`` / ``derive_letter`` /
``derive_trend_decoration`` and generating the operator-readable
``status_reason`` per the RC v2 N/A taxonomy (Principle 2 + the reason
templates, `system-report-card-revamp-260522.md`).

Every tile builder (Portfolio Outcome, Predictor, Executor, …) builds its
components through here so the status semantics + reason phrasing are uniform.

    ``status`` is derived via the lib (so producer/consumer agree) unless an
    explicit ``status`` is passed — used for band metrics (e.g. beta's two-sided
    target) that the single-direction ``derive_status`` can't express. Diagnostic
    band metrics pass their own status; everything else lets the lib derive it.

    ``higher_is_better`` only affects the trend glyph; when omitted it's inferred
    from the target/red-line ordering (matches ``derive_status``).

    ``estimator`` / ``measurement_horizon`` / ``reliability`` are the L4562
    metric-reliability contract (ARCHITECTURE §18). A ``criticality="critical"``
    metric MUST declare a non-empty ``estimator`` that is not one of the
    proven-bad classes (``_FORBIDDEN_ESTIMATORS``) — enforced here at
    construction so a brittle metric never reaches the Director. ``reliability``
    defaults to ``"high"`` for a declared critical estimator; pass ``"low"``
    explicitly for a metric with a known validity caveat (e.g. an in-sample-
    prone IC) so the digest can flag it and the Director can hedge.

    ``permanent_na_reason`` (config#1153, operator Option A 2026-07-11) marks an

    an N/A-NOT-IMPL (so it never blocks a supporting/diagnostic tile's GREEN)
    but its ``status_reason`` becomes ``"Accepted permanent N/A — <reason>"`` and
    the record carries ``permanent_na=True`` so the cliff-inventory can tell it
